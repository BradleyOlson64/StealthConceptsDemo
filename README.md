# StealthConceptsDemo
This is an Unreal Engine 4 project geared towards exploring stealth mechanics with the engine. I wouldn't call it a proper game, since it lacks the visual polish even an indie release would have. None the less it sports many neat game features and is the first fully multiplayer capable project I've made.
